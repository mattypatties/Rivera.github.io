        <h2>Hi, I'm Matty</h2>
        <p> I'm a first-year student in cybersecurity. One of my passions
            are guitars. I go crazy for guitars. I started with a ukulele
            in 3rd grade. Eventually, my parents bought me an acoustic guitar. 
            However, I only took interest in it when I started bringing 
            it to school when I was in 7th grade. Ever since then guitars 
            are one of my favorite things in the world. I guess you could 
            call me a Guitar Geek. This website is a showcase
            of guitars I personally like, along with amplifiers, and my personal
            gear. Enjoy!
        </p>
